1.  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A:  You would use a remote repository when other people are also working on a project. That way everyone can add to the project without sendig large files or having to be in the same place.


2.  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A:  Because that way you are able to choose what version of code you would like to have in your local repsoitory. For example someone added a feature that you don't want to implement until later, automatic pulling won't give you the choice of when  to implement those changes and may disrupt your workflow.
